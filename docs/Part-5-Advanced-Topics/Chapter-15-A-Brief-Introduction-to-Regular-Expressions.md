## A brief Introduction to Regular Expressions

An expression is a string of characters.Thoese characters having an interpretation above and beyond their literal meaning are called *metacharaters*.

A Regular Expression contains one or more of the following:

- A character set.These are the characters retaining their literal meaning.

- An anchor.These designate (anchor) the position in the line of the text that the RE is to match.

- Modifier.These expand or narrow (modify) the range of text the RE is to match.

The main uses for Regualr Expression are text searches and string manipulation.An RE matches a single character or a set of characters --- a  string or a part of string.
